"the path to the roundup tracker you're working with. A roundup tracker\n"
"is where roundup keeps the database and configuration file that defines\n"
"an issue tracker. It may be thought of as the issue tracker's \"home\n"

"quotes, either ' or \". A single space may also be backslash-quoted. If a\n"
